## Background

There is an insufficient availability of human experts to assist students in 
reading competency and comprehension. The goal of this porject is to create an 
socially assistive robot that can be used by therapists, teachers, and parents 
to help children and adults develop and practice reading comprehension skills 
while they do not have access to specialists. This robot enables the user to 
improve their reading skills without an educator present and allows educators to 
review the student's performance remotely. 

The design includes a robot and a phone running an app. The basic tasks that the
robot performs is to give instructions for the reading sessions and prompts the
student to start reading. The robot then records the passage read to allow a 
teacher or therapist to review it at a later time. Then, the robot asks 
questions based on the reading and gives constructive feedback based on the 
correctness of the responses. During the interaction, the robot has the ability
to tilt the phone back and forth, wiggle its antennas, and show different faces
on its LED screen. This gives the interaction with the user more embodiment.
